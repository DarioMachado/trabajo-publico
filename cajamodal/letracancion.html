    If you want to eat some dog, I have good news<br />
    There's an annual dog festival<br />
    Where you can eat all the dog you want<br />
    And it's located in Yulin Guangxi China<br />
    <br /></div>

    <div class="cancion">
    And the festival spans about ten days<br />
    With 15,000 dogs consumed<br />
    And it goes from the 21st to the 30th of June<br />
    I just wanna let you know, I'm just trying to be a bro<br />
    So, you first take a flight to Guangzhou, China<br />
    <br/>
    </div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    Once you get off at that airport<br />
    You wanna ask around for the Guangxi provincial bus<br />
    And it costs 20 US dollars<br />
    And it's a four-and-a-half-hour ride<br />
    <br/>
    </div>


    
    
    <div class="cancion">
    And you get off at Maoming West<br />
    Just remember, Maoming West<br />
    Now, you might have to stay there a full night<br />
    Depending on the time you arrive<br />
    <br /></div>

    <div class="cancion">
    Because the next bus that goes to Yulin<br />
    Only runs like once a day<br />
    And you have to buy another ticket<br />
    It's about another 22 bucks<br />
    <br /></div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    But from there, it goes straight to Yulin<br />
    Soon enough, you'll be eating some dog<br />
    Now, there are about 8 available hotels in Yulin<br />
    I'm checking online, now<br />
    <br /></div>
    <div class="cancion">
    I suggest the Yulin Lijing International Hotel<br />
    Offering a sauna and fitness center<br />
    Wow, it's not too bad at all<br />
    <br /></div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    Never mind, it's 50 bucks a night<br />
    But with free complementary breakfast<br />
    And a free cancelation fee<br />
    So, it's not a bad as I thought<br />
    <br /></div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    When you're ready the concierge will know<br />
    Exactly which festival you're talking about<br />
    And he or she will give you directions<br />
    So, take a cab<br />
    <br /></div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    But don't get ripped off<br />
    If you're white, they'll charge you double<br />
    I shit you not<br />
    I shit you not<br />
    <br /></div>
    
    <div class="cancion">
    But anyways, enjoy your flight<br />
    Goodbye<br />
    Enjoy the dog festival
